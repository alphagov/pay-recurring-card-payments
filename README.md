# Recurring card payments `BETA`

This is a place for service teams on GOV.UK Payâ€™s beta on Recurring Card Payments to find information and discuss topics regarding the beta.

We'll use this repository to publish things like:
- Week notes
- Draft technical documents
- Draft API documentation
- Requirements for services taking recurring payments
- Any prototypes we design

## Contributing
During beta we will be publishing information in the [Issues](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-recurring-card-payments/issues) section. You will be able to view, comment and see comments by others.

## Contact
The GOV.UK Pay team will send group updates and workshop invites to a mailing list. This also allows beta partners to ask questions and for the questions and responses to be visible by all members.
